The classifier can distiguish if an image coresponds to a **white Apple Magic Mouse 2 mouse** or not.

If the input image is a "white Apple Magic Mouse 2 mouse" the classifier will predict its category as "apple", and if it is another mouse, "other".

**Note:** this project was made thanks to [Lobe.ai](https://lobe.ai/) and this is just a simple half hour project.
